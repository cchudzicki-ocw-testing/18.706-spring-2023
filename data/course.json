  "course_description": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 90 minutes / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis is an introductory graduate course, although ad\u0002vanced undergraduates are also welcome to attempt it. Close familiarity with undergraduate algebra (groups, rings, modules etc.) will be assumed.\u00a0\n\nCourse Description\n\nThe beginning of the course will cover fundamental con\u0002cepts forming the basic vocabulary of the algebraic language in today\u2019s math.  \nThese include:  \nRings, modules. (Semi)simple rings, division rings. Wedderburn Theo\u0002rem, Jordan-Hoelder and Krull-Schmidt Theorem. Prime radical, Jacobson  \nradical. Artinian rings.  \nCategories: Yoneda Lemma, adjoint functors. Additive and abelian cat\u0002egories. Morita theory.  \nBasic homological algebra: \u03b4-functors, Tor\u2019s, Ext\u2019s, group (co)homology,  \nglobal dimension etc.\n\nThese will be followed by somewhat more specialized topics\n\nKoszul algebras.  \nOre Localization and Goldie Theorem.  \nCentral simple algebras and Brauer group.  \nPI algebras.  \nGrowth of algebras.  \nSome ideas of Noncommutative geometry.\u00a0\n\nSources\n\nPossible references include the book by P.M. Cohn \u201cFurther  \nAlgebra and Applications\u201d (chapters 2, 4, 5, 7, 8; an earlier edition of ba\u0002sically the same text is volumes 2,3 of the series \u201cAlgebra\u201d by the same  \nauthor); C.A. Weibel \u201cAn introduction to homological algebra\u201d and notes  \nby Mike Artin and by Pavel Etingof available at the course website.\n\nHomework/Exams/Grading\n\nBiweekly homework assignments will be  \ngiven.  \nGrades will be based on the homework. \u00a0Students are also invited to prepare an optional expository paper for extra  \ncredit. Suggested topics for will be posted on the class website. Please talk  \nto the instructor before starting to work on the paper.",
