## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 90 minutes / session

## Prerequisites

This is an introductory graduate course, although advanced undergraduates are also welcome to attempt it. Close familiarity with undergraduate algebra (groups, rings, modules etc.) will be assumed. 

## Course Description

The beginning of the course will cover fundamental concepts forming the basic vocabulary of the algebraic language in today’s math. 

- Concepts:
    - Rings, modules
    - (Semi)simple rings, division rings
    - Wedderburn Theorem, Jordan-Hoelder and Krull-Schmidt Theorem
    - Prime radical, Jacobson radical
    - Artinian rings
- Categories:
    - Yoneda Lemma, adjoint functors
    - Additive and abelian categories
    - Morita theory
- Basic homological algebra: 
    - δ-functors
    - Tor’s, Ext’s
    - group (co)homology
    - global dimension, etc.
- These will be followed by somewhat more specialized topics:
    - Koszul algebras
    - Ore Localization and Goldie Theorem
    - Central simple algebras and Brauer group
    - PI algebras
    - Growth of algebras
    - Some ideas of Noncommutative geometry

## Lecture Notes and Readings

There is not required textbook for the course. A full set of lecture notes are provided.  Possible other references include:

- the book by P.M. Cohn “Further  Algebra and Applications” (chapters 2, 4, 5, 7, 8; an earlier edition of basically the same text is volumes 2,3 of the series “Algebra” by the same  author); 
- C.A. Weibel “An introduction to homological algebra” and 
- Notes by Prof. Mike Artin 
- Notes by Prof. Pavel Etingof 

## Assignments and Grading

Biweekly homework assignments will be given.  Grades will be based on the homework.  Students are also invited to prepare an optional expository paper for extra credit.  There are no exams.
